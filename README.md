Internship Portal

Abstract:

The internship portal is an online platform designed to connect students and recent graduates with internship opportunities. It serves as a bridge between students who are seeking practical experience in their chosen field and companies looking for fresh talent. The portal offers a comprehensive database of internship openings across various industries, allowing students to search and apply for positions that match their interests and skill sets.

Introduction:

Internship programs have become an essential part of the academic and professional journey for students and recent graduates. These programs provide students with practical experience and exposure to real-world scenarios, which can help them develop the necessary skills to succeed in their chosen field. However, finding internship opportunities can be a daunting task for students, and companies may struggle to attract the right candidates.

The internship portal is a solution to this problem, offering a centralized platform where companies can post their internship openings and students can search and apply for these positions. The portal serves as a bridge between students and companies, providing a seamless experience for both parties. With an intuitive interface and comprehensive search filters, students can easily find internship opportunities that match their interests and qualifications, while companies can attract the right candidates for their programs.

The internship portal aims to simplify the process of finding internships, creating a more efficient and effective way for students and companies to connect. By leveraging technology, the portal provides a streamlined experience for both students and companies, reducing the time and effort required to find the right match.

5.	Assign mentors: Assign a mentor to each batch of students according to their field. The mentor should be able to view the tasks assigned to their batch and verify the tasks submitted by students.

6.	Assign tasks: Assign tasks to students. Once the student completes the task, they should submit the task via GitHub and share the link with the assigned mentor through the student dashboard.

7.	Verify tasks: The mentor should review the task submitted by the student, approve it if it meets the required standards, and unlock the next task.

8.	Generate certificates: Once all the tasks are completed and approved, the student should receive a certificate automatically generated by the system. The student can download the certificate from their dashboard.
